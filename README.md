Analyze Personal Spotify Music Trends. 

I was curious to see if over time the type of music I listen to has changed. Have I started listening to quieter genres or more bass-heavy tracks? 
After a small search, it turned out Spotify conveniently provides the Spotify python package that interacts with their Web API and allows you to tap into their datasets.
I’ve shared the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub, in case others’ are interested in similar analysis for themselves or would like to build on top of it.
